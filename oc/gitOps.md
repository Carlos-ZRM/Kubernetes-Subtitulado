##  What means GitOps
> GitOps is a methodology and practice that uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver infrastructure as code. 

**Pillars**
- Git is the single source of truth
- Treat everything as code
- Operations are performed through Git workflows
**Principles**
- Declarative A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively
- Versioned and immutable The desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability and versioning and retains a complete version history.
- Pulled automatically Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.
- Continuously reconciled Software agents continuously observe the actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.

# Why GO

Deal Infra Operations as a Code. 
- Standard workflow : Use familiar tools and Git workflows from application development teams Enhanced security Review changes beforehand, detect configuration drifts, and take action Visibility and audit Capture and trace any change to clusters through Git history Multicluster consistency Reliably and consistently configure multiple environments and multiple Kuber‚Äê netes clusters and deployment
