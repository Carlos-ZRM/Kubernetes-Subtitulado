##  What means GitOps
> GitOps is a methodology and practice that uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver infrastructure as code. 

**Pillars**
- Git is the single source of truth
- Treat everything as code
- Operations are performed through Git workflows
**Principles**
- Declarative A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively
- Versioned and immutable The desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability and versioning and retains a complete version history.
- Pulled automatically Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.
- Continuously reconciled Software agents continuously observe the actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.
